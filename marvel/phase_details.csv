PHASE 1,"As of my last update in September 2021,Marvel Studios had already completed several phases of their cinematic universe. However,if we were to describe ""Phase 1"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it refers to the initial set of interconnected films that laid the foundation for the expansive superhero saga.","Phase 1 started with Iron man & concluded with ""The Avengers,""which was a monumental success and paved the way for future phases, expanding the MCU into a multi-film franchise that now includes three phases beyond the initial one. As of 2021, the MCU has grown to become one of the most significant and successful film franchises in history, with numerous interconnected films, TV shows,and a wide array of beloved characters.","[""Ironamn"",""The Incredible Hulk"",""Ironman 2"",""Thor"",""Captain America"",""The Avengers""]",Phase1.html,./Images/movies-page/phase1-poster.jpg
